The test items are collected from the Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test (högskoleprovet), currently spanning the years 2006--2021 and 822 vocabulary test items. The task for the tested system is to determine which synonym or definition of five alternatives is correct for each test item.

Recommended evaluation measures	Krippendorff's pseudoalpha (the official SuperLim measure), a derived Krippendorff's alpha. For this dataset, pseudoalpha = (Accuracy - 1/5) / (4/5), where accuracy is the proportion of correctly answered questions. Other possible measures: accuracy.
Dataset function(s)	Few-shot training ("prompting"), testing
Recommended split(s)	A few-shot training set (aka "prompt", 10%), test set (90%). The prompt was added with the GPT-like models in mind. For those models that do not need a prompt, it can be ignored.
