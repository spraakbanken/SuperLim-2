Abstract*	The SWE-DN corpus is based on 1,963,576 news articles from the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter (DN) during the years 2000--2020. The articles are filtered to resemble the CNN/DailyMail dataset both regarding textual structure
Funded by*	SweClarin

II. USAGE	
Key applications	Training text summarizers, both extractive and abstractive.
Intended task(s)/usage(s)	Given a text (article), provide its summary.
Recommended evaluation measures	Harmonic mean of Bleu and Rouge; Rouge, BERTScore, Coh-Metrix
Dataset function(s)	Model development
Recommended split(s)	"The articles in the dataset fall into five categories: domestic news, economy, sports, culture, other. The training set consists of the first three categories (78% of the dataset), the test set contains the fourth category (12%), the test set the fifth category (10%). The purpose is to have a cross-domain split which helps evaluate the model's ability to generalize to new data. The ""other"" category was chosen for the test set as the most diverse one (and presumably the most difficult)."
